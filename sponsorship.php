				<h2>Sponsorship</h2>
				<p>HoHoTO would not be possible without the truly generous support of our many sponsors.</p>
				<p>A commitment to HoHoTO directly connects your brand with the shiniest and most wonderful members of Toronto’s tech, media, digital marketing, social media and PR communities.</p>
				<p>If you choose to come on board as a sponsor, it becomes the personal mission of our team to ensure that everyone at the event (and thousands more who are following the live and post-event coverage) will get to know just how terrific you are.</p>
